In this project, the server offers streaming services to clients.
The "free version" offers streams of ascii films in multicast groups (Multicast UDP channels).
The "premium version" offers streams of ascii films in a private premium channel (TCP channel).
The project includes socket programming and multithreaded programming.
This client-server project is the final project of the course "Computer Communication Networks 2" in Ben-Gurion University.
