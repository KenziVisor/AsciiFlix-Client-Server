In this project, the server offers streaming services to clients.
The "free version" offers streams of ascii films in multicast groups (Multicast UDP channels).
The "premium version" offers streams of ascii films in a private premium channel (TCP channel).
Control messages between clients and the server are forwarded in a TCP channel for each client.
The project includes socket programming and multithreaded programming.
The terminal input for the client code is: ip address of the server and port of the application.
The terminal input for the server code is: tcp control port, tcp premium port, multicast address of the first film, udp port of the first film, list of files of films
This client-server project is the final project of the course "Computer Communication Networks 2" in Ben-Gurion University.
